## Topic: Emails

### Business Problem

As an email service provider, we want to improve the user experience by reducing the number of spam emails that reach users' inboxes. Spam emails can be a significant annoyance and a security risk for users, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of trust in our service.

To tackle this, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). By doing so, we can filter out spam emails and ensure they do not reach the users' inboxes, thereby enhancing the overall quality of our email service.

## Data Science Methodology Application

### 1. Business Understanding

- **Objective:** The main objective is to reduce the number of spam emails that reach users' inboxes to improve the user experience and maintain trust in our email service.

- **Key Questions:**
  - What are the distinguishing characteristics of spam emails compared to legitimate (ham) emails?
  - How accurately can we classify emails as spam or not spam?
  - How can we ensure the model adapts to new spam techniques over time?

- **Success Criteria:**
  - A high-accuracy spam classification model that correctly identifies spam emails with minimal false positives (i.e., marking legitimate emails as spam).
  - A noticeable reduction in the number of spam emails reaching users' inboxes, leading to improved user satisfaction and engagement.

### 2. Data Understanding

- **Data Collection:**
  - Gather a large dataset of emails, including both spam and legitimate emails (ham). The dataset should include various email types, such as marketing emails, newsletters, personal emails, and known spam emails.
  - Collect metadata associated with the emails, such as sender information, subject lines, email content, and any existing spam labels.

- **Data Exploration:**
  - Analyze the collected data to identify patterns and characteristics typical of spam emails, such as specific keywords, sender domains, and email structure.
  - Identify any correlations between email features (e.g., certain words or phrases) and the likelihood of an email being classified as spam.

### 3. Data Preparation

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handle missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset. Remove emails with incomplete or irrelevant information.
  - Preprocess email content to remove special characters, HTML tags, and other non-relevant elements.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Create features that could be predictive of spam, such as the frequency of certain keywords (e.g., "free," "win," "click"), the presence of links, or the use of certain domains.
  - Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from the email content, such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores, n-grams, and word embeddings.

- **Data Splitting:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.

### 4. Modeling

- **Model Selection:**
  - Choose appropriate machine learning models for text classification, such as Naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or more advanced models like random forests and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or transformers).
  - Consider using ensemble methods to combine the strengths of multiple models for improved performance.

- **Model Training:**
  - Train the selected models on the training dataset, using cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) curve. Focus on minimizing false positives (ham emails classified as spam) to avoid negatively impacting user experience.

### 5. Evaluation

- **Model Validation:**
  - Test the selected model on the unseen test dataset to validate its performance and ensure it generalizes well to new data.
  - Conduct additional testing with a live subset of user emails to evaluate the model's performance in a real-world scenario.

- **Business Evaluation:**
  - Assess the model's effectiveness in achieving the business objective. Check if the model significantly reduces the number of spam emails reaching users' inboxes without increasing false positives.
  - Evaluate the model's impact on user satisfaction and engagement metrics, such as reduced spam reports and increased email open rates.

### 6. Deployment

- **Implementation:**
  - Deploy the spam classification model into the email service's filtering system. Integrate it with the existing email pipeline to classify incoming emails in real time.
  - Set up automated workflows to quarantine or delete emails classified as spam while ensuring legitimate emails reach users' inboxes.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
  - Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it as needed. This includes retraining the model with new data, refining features, and adjusting for changes in spam tactics over time.
  - Set up feedback loops with users to allow them to report misclassified emails, both spam and not spam, to improve the model's accuracy.

### 7. Feedback and Iteration

- **Feedback Collection:**
  - Gather feedback from users and stakeholders on the model's performance and areas for improvement. Pay attention to user reports of misclassified emails.
  - Collect data on new spam techniques and incorporate this information into the model to adapt to evolving threats.

- **Iteration:**
  - Use the feedback to iterate on the model and improve its predictive power. Adjust features, retrain the model, and refine the spam detection rules based on the insights gained.

By following these stages of the data science methodology, the email service provider can effectively address the business problem of reducing spam emails, ultimately leading to a better user experience, increased trust, and improved engagement with the email platform.
